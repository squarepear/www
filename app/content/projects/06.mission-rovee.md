Mission Rovee is a game where you issue commands using a terminal in order to collect minerals and complete Rovee's mission. You must navigate the terrain and keep track of your battery to ensure she complete her mission and return home safely!

Mission Rovee was created over the course of three semesters at Ball State University (Spring 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024). The game was developed using the Godot game engine and GDScript and utilizing the [Godot Unit Testing](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) (GUT) framework. Our team included 6 developers and one musician.
