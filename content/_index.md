## Who am I?

I am a software engineer who recently graduated from Ball State University with a Masters in Information & Communication Sciences and a Bachelors in Computer Science. I am also an Eagle Scout!

## What do I do?

I make stuff! I love learning new things, which has led me to develop skills in a variety of areas. Software development is my primary focus, but I also enjoy working with hardware and electronics. I have recently been working on my homelab, all running on NixOS for reproducibility and ease of management (configuration is all stored in a [git repository](https://github.com/squarepear/nixos-configs)!).

I would consider myself proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, Python, and GDScript (Godot Engine's scripting language). I am also familiar with Go, Java, C#, and Rust.
