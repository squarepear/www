NixOS is a Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager. It is declarative, meaning that you can describe the state of your system in a configuration file. This repository contains my configuration files for NixOS. I use it to configure my desktop, Raspberry Pis, and development on my macOS laptop. It ensures that my development environment is consistent across all of my devices.
