STEM Career Paths Game is a game designed to help middle-school and early high-school students learn about the many paths to STEM careers. The player navigates through four years of high-school by making decisions that impact their future.

STEM Career Paths Game was created over the course of two semesters at Ball State University (Fall 2023, Spring 2024). The game was developed using the Godot game engine and GDScript and heavily utilizing the [Godot Unit Testing](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) (GUT) framework.

Development of STEM Career Paths Game was funded by a grant from the [Indiana Space Grant Consortium](https://insgc.spacegrant.org/)
